The truth is Asia is generating more software developers, and day by day, the average age of software developers will be decreased even more.

Why we don't often see developer after the age of 40

- senior expect higher salary expectation (developers are underpaid?)
- job switching: make money without coding
- older developer can't catch up with the endless learning
- generation gap
- startup culture: demand for cheap, fast development of tech products -> turn to young developers

How-to survive

- update: the tech and the self

Endgame after `developer` role

- management
- consultancy
- niche market > specialized
- trainer
