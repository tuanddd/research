#### Explaining

Like human, data goes through a circle of life. from the derive until the collapse.

- capturing: raw data get acquired from multiple sources
- maintaining: edit, format, label > turn raw/ disorganized data into consistent system
- using: extract the benefit from data. generate insight, visulaize results, explain decision.
- publishing: make data visible on different platforms, as a part of business // in-use
- archiving: storing for future use // historical data // reference
- deleting: as simple as it sounds. when data is no longer needed, it gets removed from the system.

#### Why

By knowing which stage the data is currently in, we get to decide what's best to act during the phase, how to protect and get the most out of it.
