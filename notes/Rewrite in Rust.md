Each decade comes with a modern language that resolve a problem at the time. the blog author is guessing who is the winner for the 20s, and it's neither C or Java - despite these twos are trying to come back. It's not Go either, since he claimed Go can only work in cloud-native tools and cross platform interfaces.

The author shifts his focus to Rust, a candidate who manages to satisfy both high and low level programming, and contains the sign of modernity, such as open source and generics.

Rust was considered as a new born language since 2010, and its adoption was more like a hooby choice instead of a real language. #riir used to be a meme since every single small group gradually migrate into Rust, and they keep using #riir - rewrite it in rust as a meme whenever a migration happens.

Some keyplayers started to touch Rust since last year. Like Discord, or Morzilla. But not until the move of Google - the backbone behind Golang - that Rust begins to be taken seriously. There has been a long term debate between the domination of Go and Rust, and the fact that Google chose to migrate some of their services into Rust somehow turned the table.
