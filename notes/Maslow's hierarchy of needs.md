Maslow's hierarchy of needs is a motivational theory in psychology comprising a five-tier model of human needs, often depicted as hierarchical levels within a pyramid. From the bottom of the hierarchy upwards, the needs are: physiological (food and clothing), safety (job security), love and belonging needs (friendship), esteem, and self-actualization.Needs lower down in the hierarchy must be satisfied before individuals can attend to needs higher up. In general, humans are made of 3 main components: **physical**, **psychological** and **consciousness**, Maslow's hierarchy of needs is a ladder to bring certainty for these components.

In business, after analyzing target customers, Maslow's hierarchy of needs is applied to define needs to make suitable products or strategies.

In facts, people don't always desire certainty, since too much certainty leads to boredom. Thus, people also desire change, adventure and variety to feel alive. Variety and certainty are very much connected to each other. They sit on either side of a scale that needs to be in constant balance. When we have too much certainty we reach a level where we are running on automatic. We look for a change to break up the monotony and bring some interest. This is where innovation comes from. As people live a boring life, keep doing things in their daily routine, they tend to do a lot of things to bring change and interest into their lives, some of them are innovating and creating new things.
