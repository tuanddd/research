### Why

- Due to COVID, everything is conducted at home, everything relies mostly on hardware performance. The world is pushing for computer hardware & smart devices.
- In business, the surge in digitalization increases (such as the need in using cloud storage), cloud providers must purchase more server of meet the market's demand.
- The demand for semiconductor is rising // its supply is getting shortened.
- The bitcoin mining: https://hypebeast.com/2021/5/bitcoin-mining-consumes-more-energy-most-countries-info -> Consumption in computer: Bitcoin mining requires thousands to tens of thousands of computers operating while being cooled around the clock. Additionally, the more computers mining brings the total yield efficiency down, meaning more computers will be required in the future as the digital currencyâ€™s popularity continues to rise.

### What does it mean to us as consumer

- To meet the demand, they could invent low-quality chip
- Producers might consider selling their silicon to higher-paying buyers
- Manufacturer will tend to protect their most profitable product line > Like VinGroup has to cut down VinSmart and invest more on VinFast.
