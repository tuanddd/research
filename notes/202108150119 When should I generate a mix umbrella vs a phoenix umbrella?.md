At the end of the day, they are both the same thing. The difference is that Phoenix already generates an umbrella with two applications, one for your domain and another for the web, and if you ran `mix new` you would have to assemble everything by hand. So if you are building a web application, use Phoenix, because it will give you a head start on setting everything up.
