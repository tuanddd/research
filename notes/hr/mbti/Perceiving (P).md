#### Characteristics of P Types:

- Outwardly open, receptive, and adaptable
- Can be reluctant to state things directly (especially IPs); may express themselves in a more tangential fashion (e.g., using hints or questions)
- Are typically unenthusiastic about making detailed plans, especially when involving other people; enjoy the uncertainty of leaving things open-ended
- Slow to reach closure in beliefs or decisions
- Often viewed as good, non-judgmental listeners
- Can be skeptical toward external laws; prefer to make and follow their own rules
- Desire variety, novelty, informality, and minimal structure at work
- Often prefer to teach themselves (especially IPs); teach others by example or facilitation
- Not necessarily messy, disorganized, procrastinating, or chronically late
- Often restless, turning to a breadth of activities for stimulation (especially EPs)
