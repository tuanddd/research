Each PT has 4 [cognitive functions](obsidian://open?vault=dwarves&file=brain%2FHR%2FMBTI%2F8%20Cognitive%20Functions) that called cognitive fuctions stack. t is arranged in order of 4 layers from strong > weak:

- Dominant
- Auxiliary
- Tertiary
- Inferior

Each personality type has a certain stack and does not change. The first two are the most obvious, what outsiders see (dominant and auxiliary). In contrast, tertiary and inferior represent our weakness and blind spot. What we need to improve to achieve satisfaction and balance in life.

Ex: INFP's cognitive function stack is Fi Ne Si Te
