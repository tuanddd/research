The best practices to work with all MBTI types, ref from Atlassian

#### ISTJ: Logistician

- Don’t need much management or checking up on, just email them a to-do list at the start of the week, and you can trust them to quietly get on with it.
- The perfect type to organize and streamline any shared space online, from Dropbox to Google Docs.

#### INFJ: Advocate

- It would be a major asset to have them sit in on virtual interviews.
- Just don’t put them center stage in any Zoom meetings if you can avoid it: they don’t thrive on attention, and work far better behind the scenes.

#### INTJ: Architect

- More comfortable communicating by text
- Extremely deadline-focused, but there’s also a danger they can rush to hasty decisions, particularly without colleagues nearby to check their impulses.
- Need to be reminded to stop for a second, take their time, and let ideas germinate, rather than just rushing straight at them.

#### ISFJ: Defender

- Display incredible attention to detail, so they’re great for checking over others’ work, editing shared documents or looking over pitches and proposals at the final stage
- Very good at following rules and inspiring others to do the same

#### ISTP: Virtuoso

- Tend to excel at troubleshooting, so in a remote work environment, they can be a major tech asset.
- Very good at test driving new tools and navigating software, but they also lose focus easily so they do need to be managed.

#### SFP: Adventurer

- Can burn out quite easily
- Their energy is an asset, but it sometimes needs to be harnessed and directed in the right direction by others.

#### INFP: Mediator

- Tends to have very deep-seated values, which can cause problems because frustrations can stew when they’re offended,
- Managers need to encourage them to get any concerns out into the open. Otherwise, the key to getting the best out of this group is to encourage and reinforce meaning in their work.

#### INTP: Logician

- Really needs to be given the freedom to do things in an original way, and to be *listened* to, because they come up with the smartest solutions
- Their weak spot is that they often neglect to share decisions and solutions. If there’s an INTP on your team, encourage them to use shared documents and software as much as possible.

#### ESTP: Entrepreneur

- Keep things fun and keep them moving fast. This personality type is classically impatient, so give them a day’s worth of tasks in a project tool rather than any long-term targets.
- Very good at firefighting, because the thrill of the moment is exciting to them.
- Great at thinking outside the box.

#### ESFP: Entertainer

- Get them involved in videos, voiceovers, podcasts, or any project that involves creative performance.
- Superb in remote pitches, as they’ll bring a persuasive energy which could otherwise be lacking via computer screen.

#### ENFP: Campaigner

- A major asset in brainstorming sessions and any big picture thinking.
- Not the best starter-finishers, so deadlines can be an issue.
- They don’t always see messages or respond quickly enough to colleagues. As a result, they often need gently managing in order to realize their high creative value.

#### ENTP: Debater

- Very good at debating. This group tends to be great on new ideas and products, as well as bigger discussions about how to move the business forward
- Adept at impressing clients and pitching for new business. You just might need to remind them to mute themselves occasionally, because, if unchecked, they may dominate conversation.

#### ESTJ: Executive

- Loves to organize themselves, other people, and the world around them, which can be an asset but can also come across as bossy and aggressive – particularly when they’re dishing out instructions without any face-to-face contact
- Need to be reminded to be tactful with others, particularly in an environment where they’re primarily communicating via email or messaging apps, leaving their sentences open to greater interpretation.

#### ESFJ: Consul

- Make the best project managers, because people love working for them
- They’re organized, as well as thoughtful, so are ideal for bringing projects together on time. They’d also be a strong choice for remote onboarding new starters.

#### ENFJ: Protagonist

- People-focused diplomats, this group tends to forget their own needs in favor of the greater good, and that can sometimes be detrimental – not just in terms of burnout, but also when completing their own tasks.
- It’s always a good idea to have Protagonists lead group discussions, even if they’re not in a leadership role, because they excel at it. They should be your go-to Zoom meeting host, and at the heart of any situation involving discussion, consensus, and the bringing together of people and ideas.

#### ENTJ: Commander

- Likes big pictures and big decisions
- They don’t always see the finer details when implementing plans, that puts them at greater risk of pushing through decisions without properly taking in the views of others.
- Need to remember the necessary balance between directing and consulting.
