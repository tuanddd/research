### Project experience component

Project work (Capstone) is essential to developing software engineering skills. We recommend that approximately 30% of students’ time be devoted to realistic project work. This curriculum component can be structured in a number of ways. By the time students enter third year, they need to start working on small projects in a teamwork environment. This is good to use agile approach to allow them to complete small project in about three to six weeks. By the time they enter the last year, it is important to capstone project that covers most of the coursework, where they learn full development with all lifecycle phases in details. Capstone need to be developed cooperative with industry.
