### Software Architecture (SA)

**Sum up**

- structure the software
- Answer for: what we are building

**What** Software Architecture (SA) create a complete system architecture.

The type of architecture will decide the constrains of software design.

A software must have the charateristics (based on biz requirement). SA helps connects these characteristics into structural solution.

SA prevents the accumulation of technical debts.

**Example**

- Microservices
- Monolith
- Event-Driven
- Serverless

**How** The architecture descision must based on business requirement (scaling/ traffice volume, ...etc) Helps achieve biz goal and tech strategy

### Software Design (SD)

**Sum up**

- implement the software
- answer for: how we are building

**What** Software Design (SD) arranging the order of component is called software design.

SD responsible for code-level design.

- what each module is doing
- what problem does each module esolve

**Example**

- Factory pattern
- Adapter pattern

**How**

- Decide the function of each component and how they interact with others.
- Create the specifications of software artifacts. How individual modules/ components are amde and interact with each other
- Follows the SOLID principle
  - each class have to serve one purpose
  - open for extension. add more function without breaking the existing codes
  - use inheritance and dont break the app's logic
  - catergorize the interfaces <> structure the code so that a class won't be forced to implement a redundant function
  - decoupling the code
