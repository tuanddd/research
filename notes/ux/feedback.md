## Feedback isn't a review or a testimonial

Reviews are public, polished, and performative. Even when real, they are filtered. People write them for the next person, not for you. Testimonials are not much different. They are curated highlight reels, marketing assets.

None of this tells you what you need to improve.

## What real feedback is

Real feedback is...

- **Private:** It's a conversation, not a post.
- **Vulnerable:** Both to give and to receive.
- **Actionable:** It points to specific things you said or did.
- **Experiential:** It reflects how the interaction made them feel.
- **Useful:** Even when it's uncomfortable.

Feedback is the answer to a real question about a real experience. It requires psychological safety. We must cultivate this safety; it is not inherent in a system or form.

## How to get real feedback

You want honest feedback? Here is how we can approach it:

- **Get intellectually honest.** Be clear with yourself about what you are asking for.
- **Be transparent with others.** Say upfront, "This is not a review. This is feedback."
- **Separate your signals.** Feedback is not the same as a review or a measure of loyalty. They are not interchangeable.
- **Safety first.** We cannot elicit the truth in a hostile or superficial environment.
- **Accept all truths.** Even the ones we do not like (especially those).

## A final thought

Feedback is not about making you feel good. It is about helping you do better. If you cannot stand the truth, do not pretend you are seeking it.

If you are not prepared to hear something uncomfortable, you are not ready to ask for feedback. Fake feedback systems do not just waste time, they destroy trust.

Do not call it feedback if you cannot handle honesty, and do not expect growth if you are not willing to grapple with the truth.
