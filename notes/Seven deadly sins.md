The seven deadly sins, also known as the capital vices, or cardinal sins, is a grouping and classification of vices within Christian teachings. Behaviors or habits are classified under this category if they directly give rise to other immoralities. According to the standard list, they are pride, greed, wrath, envy, lust, gluttony, and sloth, which are contrary to the seven heavenly virtues. These sins are often thought to be abuses or excesses of natural faculties or passions (for example, gluttony abuses the natural hunger for nourishment.

- **Lust**: It is usually thought of as intense or unbridled sexual desire, lust could also mean other forms of unbridled desire, such as for money or power.
- **Glutton**: is the excess and overconsumption of anything to the point of waste.
- **Greed**: also known as avarice, cupidity, or covetousness. Greed is applied to an artificial, rapacious desire and pursuit of material possessions.
- **Sloth**: refers to a peculiar jumble of notions, dating from antiquity and including mental, spiritual, pathological, and physical states. It may be defined as absence of interest or habitual disinclination to exertion.
- **Wrath**: can be defined as uncontrolled feelings of anger, rage, and even hatred. Wrath often reveals itself in the wish to seek vengeance.
- **Envy**: can be described as a sad or resentful covetousness towards the traits or possessions of someone else.

We often hear CEOs share that their products provide some values for users such as, convenience, optimization, sharing, connectivity ... In essence, what they do is to fulfill one or some of 7 needs above. For example, Instagram is not only a social media based on photo sharing, where users share their photos and show off their lifestyles; it also satisfies the needs of envy and pride of humans.
