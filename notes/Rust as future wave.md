### Why

- Because a lot of people are adopting this language
- They are writing more things in , and about Rust
- Some of these things are things that matter to plenty of people
- Rust in getting waved into many projects (for tech big giants); and for mini actions (fine-tune command line tools)
- Most of these projects are open-sourced -> It means they're calling for more hands to increase, feedback and optimize
- Rust really resolved the problems. People see the good part of it and it get widely used (another example is Go with lightweight for scaling app)

### The issue

- Dealing with Rust maybe more complex and needs adaptability
- Developers may not write application in Rust; but they msut deal with the program that uses Rust
- Talent pool: hiring with Rust skill may be a highlight on resume

**Follow-up FAQs**

1. One of Rust's highlight is parallelism. We once endorsed Go for its `concurrency`. What's the difference between these twos? And what kind of scenario is suitable for both?
