As a tech-first consulting firm, our strength lies in turning cutting-edge research into game-changing solutions for clients. Our labs team produces innovative pilot experiments every tech wave across blockchain, AI, data, DevOps, and software construction. Meanwhile, our consulting team translates these ideas into real-world client success.

But we've hit a challenge: **our research outputs are taking too long to reach the consulting team**. Text-heavy outputs from labs require significant effort from consultants to adapt for client projects. With 2-3 pilot experiments per tech wave across five domains, the volume and complexity can overwhelm our remote workflow.

This gap impacts everyone: consultants spend extra time deciphering research outputs, labs work doesn't reach clients effectively, and clients miss out on our full expertise. This framework fixes that problem, empowering both teams to deliver better, faster results.

Our pilots are the same [experiments we choose to build](../consulting/navigate/experiment.md) based on our market thesis. We call them "pilots" when focused on transferring knowledge to our consulting team.

## The framework: five parts to bridge the gap

### 1. Alignment: Focus pilots on client needs

Make sure our pilot **experiments address real client pain** points while keeping all domains in play.

Every tech wave, we hop on a 30-minute Discord call to score 2-3 pilots per domain. We rate them 1-5 on: client relevance, market buzz, and feasibility. This aligns with our [experiment selection process](../consulting/navigate/experiment.md) but adds the consulting angle.

We'll create a quarterly "tech radar" on Memo - our "adopt, trial, assess, hold" map for experiments. One consultant and one labs person per domain become rotating "tech bridge leads."

### 2. Real-time collaboration through pilot pulse

**Get consulting input** while labs is building, plus organic sharing that spreads.

Create Discord channels (#blockchain-pilots, #ai-pilots, etc.) where labs posts drafts and questions, consultants provide feedback. Replace monthly calls with weekly 15-minute "pilot pulse" calls. Labs presents one pilot per domain in 5 minutes, then comes the magic: 2-minute "pilot spotlight" where a consultant shares a success story.

Each pilot gets one consultant buddy (1-2 hours per week) to ensure real-world viability.

### 3. Consulting-ready outputs

Transform pilot outputs into stuff consultants can pitch and deploy immediately.

Labs creates a "consulting build-log" for each pilot on Memo: problem solved, use case, implementation steps, 2-minute demo video. These are the same [build-logs we already document](/updates/build-log) for our experiments.

Convert seminars into 5-minute tutorials. Every pilot needs a working prototype stored in GitHub with clear READMEs.

### 4. Automated sharing and discovery

Remove manual hunting for information.

We auto-post new build-logs from Memo to Discord channels with AI summaries. Algolia search on Memo lets consultants find stuff by keyword. Prototypes are stored in GitHub with auto-testing Actions to ensure they actually work.

### 5. Continuous improvement loop

Track what works, fix what doesn't.

After consultants use a pilot, we can send quick feedback forms via Discord. Track "time-to-adoption" if possible. Spend time in pilot pulse calls discussing improvements.

## Challenges and how we'll handle them

### Labs team resistance to structured outputs

Labs folks love exploring freely. Adding templates might feel restrictive.

- Start small with one pilot per domain
- Let labs choose which to "transfer-ify" first
- Show impact through pilot spotlight stories
- Keep core research unchanged

### Consultants too busy for collaboration

Adding weekly calls and co-ownership might feel like extra work.

- Keep calls short (15 minutes)
- Record for async viewing
- Limit co-ownership to 1-2 hours per week
- Show direct value through client wins
- Let consultants choose relevant pilots

### Measuring success and maintaining momentum

Without clear metrics, the system might fade away.

- Track simple metrics: time-to-adoption, pilots used in client work
- Schedule monthly reviews
- Celebrate wins publicly
- Adjust based on usage data

## Your role in making this work

**Consulting team**: Join pilot pulse calls, share client pain points, try one pilot per domain. Your feedback shapes research.

**Labs team**: Create build-logs and prototypes, engage with consultants in Discord. Your work will directly impact clients.

**Everyone**: Share pilot spotlight stories when you use a pilot.

Let's close the gap together. This framework empowers you, whether you're in labs dreaming up ideas or in consulting delivering value to clients.
