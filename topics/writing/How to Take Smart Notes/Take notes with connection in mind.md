When taking notes, always write them with consideration for the notes that you already have. Notes are far more powerful when we connect them to a larger [[Ideas are networks | network of thought]], crafting idea [[Ideas are constellations | constellations]] from discrete ideas that we have [[Decontextualize ideas to make them new | recontextualized]] into new conversations.

When we write notes with an eye toward these connections from the start, we are more apt to reveal contradictions and inconsistencies in thinking; as well, being able to draw links between new ideas we encounter and old ones we've seen before can help promote deeper understanding of the material.
