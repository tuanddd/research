"Flashbulb memory" describes the tendency of our memories tend to focus on a few salient, random images, typically those connected to the emotions associated with the remembered event but also social psychological factors. Memories that involve a shared identity with others or that are rehearsed with others are more likely to achieve flashbulb status.
