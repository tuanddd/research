### Common innovation anti-patterns

There are a number of common anti-patterns among large organizations that stifle innovation. These include:

- expecting innovators to just come up with “[cool stuff](https://publish.obsidian.md/mobydiction/notes/%C2%B6+Innovation+theater)” without a guiding objective or strategy;
- forcing innovators to spend too much time building long-term business cases and projection;
- making arbitrary or capricious decisions;
- preventing innovators from talking to customers;
- not allocating sufficient resources;
- preventing teams from releasing MVPs out of fear of the impact to the brand; and
- forcing teams to adhere to rigid expectations in spite of new learning or discoveries made through [experimentation and iteration](https://publish.obsidian.md/mobydiction/notes/De-risk+innovation+by+making+smaller+bets).
