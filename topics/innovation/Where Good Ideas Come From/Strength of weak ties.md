Weak ties are strong. Steven Johnson suggests that weak ties help promote [exaptation](https://publish.obsidian.md/mobydiction/notes/%C2%B6+Expatation) of ideas, and force encounters with alternative “idea spaces.”

The concept "strength of weak ties" comes from a 1973 essay by Mark S. Granovetter.
