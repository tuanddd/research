The "adjacent possible" describes the open space of direction that the future may take—the realm of the possible that is available at a given moment. Greater change is possible, but unlikely to extend beyond the adjacent space. Innovation doesn't happen in leaps and bounds, but occurs through [small, incremental steps](https://publish.obsidian.md/mobydiction/notes/Innovation+accrues+in+small%2C+incremental+steps.). When ideas skip too far ahead beyond the "adjacent possible," they're unlikely to be adopted in the short-term. This is what we would call an idea that is "ahead of its time." They've skipped too far past the adjacent possible.

[Innovative environments](https://publish.obsidian.md/mobydiction/notes/Innovation+thrives+in+open+environments) help facilitate exploration of the adjacent possible and encourage the creative [recombination of ideas](https://publish.obsidian.md/mobydiction/notes/Ideas+are+remixes).

[Steven Johnson](https://publish.obsidian.md/mobydiction/Steven+Johnson) borrows the idea of the "adjacent possible" from [Stuart Kauffman](https://publish.obsidian.md/mobydiction/Stuart+Kauffman), who used the term to describe how simple biological systems make small, incremental steps toward becoming complex systems.

A somewhat related notion is that of a "proximate objective," used by Richard Rumelt to describe an objective that is close enough so as to be feasible.
