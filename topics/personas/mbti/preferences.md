Why learn about Personality Type (PT)?

- Better understanding yourself/others + how they tend to interact/think
- Bring insights to clarify life path (including career)

No personality type is inherently better or more desirable than another.

Personality type = 4 preferences

8 available preferences (divided into 4 dichotomies)
I (introverted) >< E (extroverted)
N (Institution) >< S (Sensing)
T (Thinking) >< F (Feeling)
P (Perceiving) >< J (Judging)

Vị trí thứ 1: I or E (mind)
vị trí thứ 2: S or N (energy)
Vị trí thứ 3: T or F (nature)
Vị trí thứ 4: P or J (tactics)
