## What is feedback-loop

- The process of witnessing users using your product
- See how they response
- Collect their reaction
- Put in measure
- Generate the pros and cins
- Pivot to improve

-> Feedback Loop happens by collecting user's opinion on your product. Then use it to grow your product better.

## How is helps driven business growth

- First, it shows that you care about your user
- It has objective opinions. which is real, and rare
- It validates the product idea
  - Does your product fits the market
  - Your product level comparing to the opponents
  - It portraits user's behaviour

-> Then you build the next version, focus on those metrics.

## Create feedback loop

Feedback loop can be created through 3 purposes

1. Gather data

- Select relevant channels where user interact
- Customer interviews
- Email follow ups
- Surveys

2. Analyze data

- Setup tracking metrics
- Select core metrics
- Analyze data -> How to improve those metrics

3. Make data useful

- Adjust the product if the feedback <> the product goal
- Inform users about the change
- Thank them for contribution -> close the loop

## Personal input

Hubspot and Traveloka are the two best example for CS and feedback loop I suppose. they're in quickly response and follow up when the service awaiting time is extended. user knows exactyly where to drop a feedback or asking FAQs.
