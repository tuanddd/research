## Comparison

![[growth-loop-hook-model.png]]

While the AARRR is a strategy focus on bringing new users, the Hook model is the process to ensure current customer to keep using the products.

They both have the initial input as getting user to engage and drive them towards an intended action. They seem to be the same until the action step. In which,

- AARRR: external action to expose brand for potential new users
- Hook: internal action to establish habit & improve the product itself.

## Can they both exist in product development?

Yes. The twos contain variances end goals. Despite the difference, it came toward to one thing: Product Growth.

- AARRR ensures that your existing users are helping you to grow.
- Hook to ensure your product becomes part of a consumerâ€™s daily habit

At which stage

- Action. The stage where user start to make a move toward the product.

| step | activation | action |

## Take-away

Product should be built based on the synergy between aarrr and hook. Specifically, it must serve these below things

- Easy & approachable action
- Customizable experience
- Variable reward

## Personal input

IMHO, this somehows reflect 'Agile' in product strategy. Nothing goes straight from point A to point B with a smooth and error-free plan. It faces changes in requirement and market demand.

It relies heavily on **user** - and how they interact with the product.
