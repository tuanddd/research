## What is #buildinpublic

#buildinpublic in a process where creators are being transparent about their product building process.

It happens through the narration of how they got there. What they do in the creating phase. Publish everything transpiration, even if it gets nasty and lame.

## The purpose

A problem with tradition launching - where makers publish their product once it's **_done & ready_**, is they might talke a while for user to get familiar, finding the mutual rhythm, acknowledge the useful points and start adopting the product.

Meanwhile, build in public enables testing for beta users. By bringing thing in public, makers get to receive the feedback and adjust accordingly. People love to hear stories, and be a part of the story.

By the time the product is ready, makers get two things:

- A finetune, market-fit product
- A community who loves and expect to put the product in real use

## The process

It's simple. When you do something, share it. Publicly share it. Currently I'm trialling build in public with Readify - a reading platform that features hightlight articles based on interest.

Adopting #buildinpublic for Readify goes through these steps:

1. Answer the What

- What's the current problem

2. Describe the How

- How we resolve it
- What benefit the product brings

3. Explain the Purpose

- A community is made out of things in **_common_**. Either they fancy or against something.
- We find this, we take it as the purpose, and we serve it to the community. That's how loyalty user gets convinced.

4. Confirm the Process:

- The kick off development
- The roadblocks and obstacles

5. Announce the Product:

- Introduce the beta version
- This helps aggregating the potential users and receive the first feedbacks

6. Update the Change:

- Update the features and changelog: At this step, we show the user their feedback matters. Our improvement based on this.
- Update the using status: Numbers, geographic and the status quo
