## General

- [[Good research starts with a good question]]
- [[Spend more time in the problem space]]
- [[User research teams should act as organizational multipliers]]
- [[Test digital experiences longitudinally]]

## Research methods

- [[Landscape of UX research methods]]
- [[UX research activities by product lifecycle]]
- [[Qualitative and quantitative research represent different philosophies of knowledge]]
- Qualitative methods
  - [[Qualitative research creates mental models about the problem space]]
  - [[Qualitative researchers care more about data saturation than sample size]]
- Quantitative methods
  - [[Measuring behaviour changes behaviour]]
  - [[Abundant data makes us jump to quantitative data as the solution to every problem]]
  - [[Quant data is lossy]]
- [[Prototypes help test ideas that are already refined]]

## Data quality and sample sizes

- What is a good sample size?
  - [[How many users should you interview]]
  - [[Qualitative researchers care more about data saturation than sample size]]
- [[UX researchers should care about strength of evidence]]

## Interpretation and reasoning

- [[¶ Abductive reasoning]]
- [[¶ Deductive reasoning]]
- [[¶ Inductive reasoning]]
- [[¶ Falsifiability]] - We shouldn't try to validate ideas but seek invalidating evidence.
- [[Four Theories of Truth]] - Epistemology offers four theories governing how to evaluate if something is true or not.

## Sharing research

- [[Show, don't tell]] - When working with senior stakeholders who wield considerable authority, it may be more effective to share with them and discuss the data that you uncovered rather than fighting to make the decision yourself.
- [[Inform rather than persuade]] - Researchers should strive to deliver information rather than persuade audiences to help foster trust in the results and in research as a practice.
- [[Expressing uncertainty doesn't undermine authority]] - Identifying areas of uncertainty is a positive practice that hasn't been shown to undermine confidence in research reporting.
- [[¶ Pyramid Principle]] - McKinsey's presentation structure, consisting of a key insight that decomposes into subordinate, mutually exclusive but comprehensively exhausted, supporting points.
- [[Research repositories should generate new knowledge]] - A repository isn't just a catalogue; it should facilitate the collision of ideas

## Research org design

- [[Democratize user research to scale user research]]

## Research artifacts

- [[§ Personas]]
