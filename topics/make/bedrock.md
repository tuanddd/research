Most products fail because they try to do everything. They become "feature salad," bloated with unnecessary features that confuse users.

There's a better way. It's called bedrock, and it's about building products that stick by focusing on what actually matters to users.

## What bedrock really means

Think of bedrock as your product's core foundation. It's the essential stuff that delivers real value to users, stripped of all the noise. Unlike the mess of features driven by internal politics or stakeholder whims, bedrock is laser-focused on user needs.

This connects beautifully with the Unix philosophy we explored in [small, sharp tools](small-sharp-tool.md). Just like `grep` excels at pattern matching and `curl` handles data transfer, your product should do one thing exceptionally well. The magic happens when simple, focused tools work together seamlessly.

Bedrock isn't a destination you reach once. It's an ongoing process of refinement. You continuously gather user feedback, run A/B tests, and actually use your own product to find pain points. The goal? Keep the core simple and user-focused while everything else changes around it.

## Bedrock vs MVP

Let's clear up some confusion. A MVP is your starting point. It's lean, quick to build, and designed to test assumptions fast. Think of a finance app's MVP with basic expense tracking and one simple report.

Bedrock is different. It's broader and more enduring. Where an MVP might pivot or fail based on early feedback, bedrock commits to a user-centric core that evolves without bloating. Your MVP can become bedrock, but only through disciplined iteration that maintains simplicity and stability.

## The AI challenge (and opportunity)

AI changes everything. Competitors can now clone your features almost instantly. Generative AI automates UI design and replicates functionality, flooding markets with look-alike products. User expectations are skyrocketing too.

This actually makes bedrock more valuable:

**When features get commoditized, experience wins.** AI can copy functionality, but it struggles to replicate authentic user trust or emotional connection.

**Simplicity stands out in noisy markets.** While competitors add AI features everywhere, a bedrock product stays clear and focused.

**Data becomes your moat.** A well-crafted bedrock collects user insights ethically, creating feedback loops that strengthen over time.

## How to build bedrock today

**Use AI to understand users better.** Machine learning can analyze behavior in real time, helping you identify which core features actually matter.

**Focus on emotional connection.** Build trust and safety into your core. This is what separates lasting products from AI-generated clones.

**Design for modularity.** Like Unix tools that pipe together beautifully, your bedrock should be flexible enough for AI-driven updates without losing simplicity.

**Speed up your feedback loops.** AI can accelerate A/B testing and user research, letting you refine your bedrock faster than competitors can copy it.

## Why this matters now

When AI commoditizes features, products win through trust and simplicity. The path forward is clear: start with what users need, iterate with AI, and stay focused on real value.

The key insight: sacrifice short-term growth for long-term stability. In a world of infinite AI possibilities, focus becomes your competitive advantage.
