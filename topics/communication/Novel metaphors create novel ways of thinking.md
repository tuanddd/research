Imaginative or novel metaphors offer new ways of thinking about familiar ideas or concepts. They either extend existing metaphors, develop previously unused parts of an existing metaphor, or provide a completely new metaphor and, therefore, way of looking at something. In other words, "new metaphors have the power to create a new reality" insofar as they provide new ways to interpret to interpret, and then respond to, experiences. They may further help us create new similarities between previously unlike ideas, concepts, or objects. Metaphorical shifts, therefore, can even inspire cultural and social change.
