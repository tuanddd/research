"Objectivism" assumes that the world comprises concrete, knowable objects that are classified in terms of inherent properties. According to objectivism, there is an objective reality; but, because humans are prone to making errors, we cannot trust their subjective judgment. Therefore, we turn to science to provide us with a methodology for evaluating what is true. Objectivity is a fundamental good, and only objective knowledge is true knowledge. Objectivism has come to be the predominant perspective in Western society today. It offers the comfort of consistency and clarity.
