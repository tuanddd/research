## Summary

The most successful leaders practice what Martin calls "integrative thinking": an approach to problem-solving that embraces complexity and eschews binary, either/or thinking. Integrative thinkers are able to consider the problem holistically, rather than as a series of discrete decisions or trade-offs, and adopt a broad view of salience to develop unique, creative approaches to the problem space.
