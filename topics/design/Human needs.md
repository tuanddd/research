We had already known about the software development process which helped all team members have an overview of building a product. To get a better insight into startup CEO/founders' incentive, we continued to learn about where ideas come from, why people want to bring an idea into reality, and what a good idea is.

In the kickoff meeting before initiating a project, we often hear that the incentive of making a product is to realize a problem or problems of a group of users and they (startup) want to solve them. In another way, the idea usually comes from human needs or demands. In order to better understand human needs, we went through some popular frameworks that are used in many successful products.

- [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs]]
- [[Seven deadly sins]]
- [[Skandhas - the five aggregates]]

Applying this framework to product design, a product not only meets the needs of users, but also must satisfy all human components, both physically, mentally, and emotionally, and consciousness. During the journey of users to accomplish their task, besides emotion, we should evaluate all components, and transform the negative factors into the positive ones.

These frameworks is used to analyze human needs. Basically, ideas come from responding to human needs to bring back some value (material or non-material). Before an idea comes into play, it is important to carefully measure and evaluate the responsiveness to the needs and its value.
