DeFi is an ecosystem of financial services built on Blockchain technologies, typically using [[Smart Contract]]. DeFi consists of applications and peer-to-peer protocols developed on decentralized blockchain networks that require no access rights for easy lending, borrowing, or trading of financial tools.

DeFi is built from 3 waves of blockchain innovation:

1. Invented in 2009, starting with Bitcoin, brings distributed ledger/blockchain --> peer-to-peer transfer (P2P) & non-sovereign digital asset (non-sovereign)
2. Defined by Ethereum, unlike blockchain, ETH's native programming language Solidity can be used to create an application, turning it into a globally accessible supercomputer.
3. Coin boom 2017, marking the sponsorship of a series of [[¶ DApp]] --> decentralized financial ecosystem
4. The 4th wave is Defi, which is a combination of the 3 waves above

Two main criterias:

- **Permissionless**: server anyone, regardless of faction, no central authority
- **Transparency**: all documents can be inspected and reviewed because they are open source. Every transaction is recorded on a blockchain -> data discovery for investment or investigation
