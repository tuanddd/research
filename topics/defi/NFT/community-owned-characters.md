## The trend of owning a character

These decentralized autonomous organizations [[DAO]] provide creators around the world with a mechanism to form new NFT characters and communities, with real money - just like compelling fantasy sports that want to take the place of sports fans in terms of team ownership (and potentially financial returns).

## How DAO make this happen?

There is a decentralized version market called "Fantasy Hollywood"

- Works based on smart contract and self-executing code of blockchain
- Issue tokens based on members' contributions
- These tokens can be used to give voting or governance rights, as well as can increase in value when there are many participants --> Same as shares

## Build a community around those characters

There are currently 2 approaches:

1.  Character setting and IP renewal
2.  Financial benefit based on your own character

## Some common NFT characters

**1. CryptoKitties** One of the first NFT projects to gain significant traction was CryptoKitties. This game built on Ethereum allows players to collect, breed and trade virtual cats.

**2. CryptoPunks** Aimed at 8-bit style, all with unique features. Development of the ERC-721 token standard for future digital collections. This project became even more popular in 2021, after several CryptoPunks sold for millions of dollars, making them one of the most expensive NFTs.

**3. Gods Unchained** A digital card collecting game. In it, tokens are issued as NFTs on the blockchain. Since each digital collectible card is unique, players can own and trade them just like physical cards.
