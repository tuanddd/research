## Why "seeding" matters in GEO

Seeding means placing your memo’s key ideas or summaries on platforms like Reddit, YouTube, and Quora, places that large language models crawl for fresh, trustworthy content. If you want your work to show up in AI-generated answers, you can’t just publish on your own site and hope for the best. You need to meet the models where they are.

You don’t have to do everything at once. Even posting a strong summary on one platform can boost your memo’s chances of being cited.

## Reddit tactics

Reddit is a goldmine for LLMs. Perplexity, ChatGPT, and others reference Reddit threads heavily—often more than standalone blogs.

**Where to Post**

- r/Programming, r/Golang, r/AI, r/LearnProgramming
- Pick subreddits with 50K+ members and active daily threads

**Thread format**

- Title (max 60 characters):
`Memo Highlights: Building a Deep-Search Pipeline in 3 Steps`
- Body (100–150 words):
    - Opening hook: State the problem in one sentence
    - Three key points: Bullet out your memo’s takeaways
    - Link: Full memo URL at the end
- Call to action: “Questions? Share your challenges below!”

**Engagement tips**

- Reply within 1 hour to every comment to keep your thread visible.
- Upvote insightful replies to encourage quality discussion.
- Use flair if the subreddit allows (like “Article” or “Discussion”).

## YouTube clip playbook

Google AI Overviews often parse and quote video transcripts. A short, direct video can get your message into the AI ecosystem.

**Script template (30–60 seconds)**

- 0–5s: Hook
 
  “Struggling to track AI citations? Here’s how in three steps.”
- 5–20s: Bullet 1

  “Define representative prompts questions that mirror real reader queries.”
- 20–35s: Bullet 2

  “Automate nightly API calls to record citations.”
- 35–50s: Bullet 3

  “Chart weekly reference rates in Grafana and set alerts.”
- 50–60s: Outro CTA

  “Full guide at memo.d.foundation/deep-search-pipeline. Link below!”

**Production tips**

- On-screen text: Display each bullet as it appears in the memo. This helps with transcript parsing.
- Description & pinned comment: Include the full memo URL and a one-sentence summary.
- Tags & title: Use “Deep-search pipeline” and “GEO” in your video title and tags.

## Quora answer format

Quora’s Q&A structure maps directly to how LLMs organize knowledge.

**Identify questions**

- Search for topics like “How to track AI citations” or “What is reference rate?”.
- Pick questions with 1K+ followers or recent activity.

**Answer template (75–100 words)**

1. Direct answer (2–3 sentences):
“Reference rate is the percentage of questions in which an LLM cites your page.”
2. Brief rationale (1–2 sentences):
“High reference rates signal to AI that your content is authoritative and structured.”
3. Read more link:
“Learn more in our memo: memo.d.foundation/guides/reference-rate”.

**Best practices**

- Use a neutral tone, focus on insight, not marketing.
- Paste the full URL, not a link shortener.
- Engage commenters and answer follow-up questions to boost visibility.

## Measuring seeding success

| **Platform** | **What to watch** | **Tools to use** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Reddit | Upvotes, comments, new AI citations for that memo | Profound, manual prompts |
| YouTube | Views, watch-through rate, transcript hits | YouTube Analytics, Profound |
| Quora | Views, upvotes, “linked source” clicks | Quora stats, Profound |

- Record metrics before posting.
- Re-run your 20-prompt batch 24–48 hours later to gauge citation change.
- Share a before/after snapshot in your team chat.

**Pre-posting checklist**

- Title matches memo heading for semantic alignment.
- Body uses “In summary” hooks and clear bullets.
- Full memo URL is correct and visible.
- Three discussion prompts ready for replies.

**FAQ**

**What if I’m not comfortable posting on Reddit or Quora?**

Start with the platform you know best. Even one well-placed summary can make a difference. Or team up with someone who’s active in those communities.

**How do I know if my seeding worked?**

Check if your memo gets cited more often in your GEO tracking tool or batch prompts. Look for increases in upvotes, comments, or clicks on your memo link.
