"So, the thing I would say is, when you grow up, you tend to get told that the world is the way it is, and your life is just to live your life inside the world, try not to bash into the walls too much, try to have a nice family life, have fun, save a little money. But that's a very limited life. Life can be much broader, once you discover one simple fact, and that is that everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you. And you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people can use. The minute that you understand that you can poke life and actually something will, you know, if you push in, something will pop out the other side, that you can change it, you can mold it. That's maybe the most important thing. It's to shake off this erroneous notion that life is there and you're just gonna live in it, versus embrace it, change it, improve it, make your mark upon it. I think that's very important, and however you learn that, once you learn it, you'll want to change life and make it better, 'cause it's kind of messed up in a lot of ways. Once you learn that, you'll never be the same again."

*Steve Jobs, 1995 interview*

## Life is simpler than you think

**The world's complexity is largely an illusion.** Most people accept a core misconception that shapes their entire approach to life: we believe the structures around us are fixed, unchangeable systems created by superior minds. This belief keeps us passive, accepting limitations that don't actually exist.

The reality is startlingly different. Every technology you use, every business model you encounter, every social norm you follow was created by people with the same cognitive abilities you possess. They weren't geniuses with supernatural insight. They were individuals who recognized a simple truth: life responds when you push against it.

This insight strips away the mystique we attach to innovation and change. The smartphone didn't emerge from a secret laboratory of superhuman intellects. Apple itself started in a garage with two college dropouts who decided to poke at the computing industry. They discovered what the interview reveals: push in one place, and something pops out elsewhere.

## How to leverage life's malleable nature

The practical application of this insight comes down to systematic experimentation. Life's simplicity means you can test, adjust, and iterate your way to meaningful change without requiring permission or perfect preparation.

**Start with small experiments.** You don't need a master plan or massive resources. The Apple founders began with a simple circuit board. Today's tools make experimentation even easier. A blog post can test an idea, a basic app can validate a concept, a conversation can open new opportunities. Each small action teaches you how reality responds to pressure.

**Question assumed limitations.** Every industry, every social system, every "rule" was established by people. Ask yourself: what assumption am I accepting without testing? Why can't a product be simpler, cheaper, or more accessible? Why can't a process be faster or more efficient? These questions reveal pressure points where life might yield to your push.

**Build for real problems.** The most effective approach focuses on creating "things that other people can use." Target genuine frustrations or unmet needs around you. The most successful changes address specific pain points that people actually experience. Start with the user's problem, not your preferred solution.

**Persist through resistance.** When you poke life, it pushes back. Funding doesn't materialize, users complain, technology fails. This resistance isn't personal judgment, it's mechanical response. Even Apple faced setbacks with NeXT and early struggles, yet continued pushing. Treat obstacles as data points, not verdicts.

## Why this matters now

Today's platforms amplify your ability to poke life. A single post can spark movements, basic prototypes can attract global attention, and open-source tools let you build from anywhere. The barriers that existed in 1995 have largely disappeared.

Yet most people still operate under the old assumption: that life is fixed and they must navigate carefully within predetermined boundaries. This creates massive opportunities for those who embrace life's malleable nature.

**The problems are waiting.** As the interview points out, life is "messed up in a lot of ways." Climate change, education access, healthcare efficiency, workplace satisfaction - these challenges persist because not enough people believe they can be changed. Each represents a place where focused pressure could yield significant results.

The transformation described in that 1995 interview is permanent. Once you truly understand that you can shape reality, you can't return to passive acceptance. The question becomes: what part of life will you poke next?
