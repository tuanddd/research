The reproducible issue is resolved in the [previous part](≈%20Nix%20-%20Build%20the%20same%20thing%20at%20any%20time.md). But we still have another problem when using Docker build, it is shadow copies. This issue comes from the underutilization of Content-addressable storage in Docker of Docker build. It even lets build time slower.
